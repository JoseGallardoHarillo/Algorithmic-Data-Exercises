# Non-Linear Recursive Exercises

## Exercise 1:

* Input: A 2D array (matrix) of integers of size n x n, where n = 2^m, with m ≥ 1.
* Output:

  - True: if the four corners and the subarrays recursively meet the condition of having distinct integers.
  - False: otherwise.

## Exercise 2:

* Input:  Two numbers, a and b.
* Output: Boolean indicating whether a is a multiple of b using only addition and subtraction.
  


## Exercise 3:

* Input: Two numbers, a (Long), and n (int).
* Output: aⁿ taking its properties into account.

## Exercise 4:

* Input: Two numbers, a (Long), and n (int).
* Output: aⁿ taking its properties into account.
