# Non-Linear Recursive Exercises

## Exercise 1:

* Input: A 2D array (matrix) of integers of size n x n, where n = 2^m, with m â‰¥ 1.
* Output:

  - True: if the four corners and the subarrays recursively meet the condition of having distinct integers.
  - False: otherwise.

## Exercise 2:

* Input:  A sequence of integers, which can be both positive and negative.
* Output: The maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of the sequence.
  
## Exercise 3:

* Input: An integer \( n \) for which we want to calculate the value of \( f_n \) based on the recurrence relation:  
 $f_n = 4f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} + f_{n-3}$, with initial values:  
$f_2 = 1$, $f_1 = 1$, $f_0 = 2$.
* Output: The value of \( f_n \) calculated using the given recurrence relation.

## Exercise 4:

* Input: Two numbers, a and b.
* Output:
  - a + $b^2$
