# PD/BT/A* Exercises

## Exercise 1 (PD, A*):
An English academy has n students to be distributed into m groups (n is a multiple of m).
Each group has a different schedule and teacher. For each student, the affinity they have for belonging to each of the groups is known (an integer value in the range [0,5]).

The goal is to determine the distribution of students into groups such that all groups have the same number of students, maximizing the total affinity achieved for all students, while taking into account that it is not allowed to assign a student to a group for which they have an affinity of 0.

## Exercise 2 (PD, A*):
A law firm has a team of n people who must analyze m interrelated cases (m â‰¥ n), and the goal is to complete the overall analysis as quickly as possible, working in parallel.
Each case will be analyzed by a single lawyer, and each lawyer can analyze multiple cases. The estimated time (in hours) that each lawyer takes to analyze each specific case is known (this time may differ for each case depending on which lawyer conducts the analysis).

Determine the optimal assignment of cases to lawyers to achieve the stated goal (completing the analysis of all cases as quickly as possible).
    
## Exercise 3 (PD, A*, manual BT):
There are n products, each of which has a price and offers a set of functionalities (the same product may have more than one functionality).
The goal is to design a batch by selecting products that collectively cover a desired set of functionalities at the lowest possible price.

## Exercise 4 (PD, A*, manual PD):
Given a set of integers, determine whether it can be partitioned into three subsets such that the sum of the elements in the three subsets is the same, and the size of one of them is as small as possible.
